1. Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication (\*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides one number by another.
Percentage (%): Calculates the percentage of a number. 2. Advanced Features:

Decimal Point (.): Allows input of decimal numbers.
Clear (AC): Clears the current calculation.
Delete Last (DEL): Removes the last character or number entered.
Result Calculation (=): Computes the final result of the entered expression.

3. Responsive Design:

Media Queries: Adjusts the layout and font sizes based on screen size to ensure the calculator is usable on both large screens (desktops) and small screens (mobiles).
Grid Layout: Organizes buttons in a grid for a clean and efficient layout. 4. Error Handling:

Error Message (ERRoR): Displays an error message if the user enters an invalid expression (e.g., division by zero or malformed input). 5. Button Styling:

Color Coding: Differentiates between function buttons (e.g., AC, DEL, =) and number/operator buttons using different colors (e.g., red for =, black for operators).
Hover Effects: Buttons can change color or style when hovered to provide a visual cue to the user. 6. Accessibility:

Keyboard Support: Allow users to input values using the keyboard (e.g., pressing 1, +, = to perform calculations).
Focus Styles: Add focus effects on buttons to improve accessibility for keyboard and screen reader users. 7. History (Optional Advanced Feature):

Calculation History: Display a history of previous calculations or allow users to view past results.
Memory Functions: Implement memory buttons like M+, M-, MR to store and recall values.

8. Customizable Themes:

Light/Dark Mode: Allow users to toggle between light and dark themes for better readability in different lighting conditions.

9. Scientific Calculator (Optional Advanced Feature):

Square Root (âˆš): Compute square roots.
Exponentiation (^): Raise numbers to powers.
Trigonometric Functions: Implement sine, cosine, tangent, etc., for scientific calculations.
